# Smart Recipe Generator Project Summary

## Project Overview
The Smart Recipe Generator app is designed to help users create AI-generated recipes based on selected ingredients and dietary preferences. The app uses a Node.js-based stack with MongoDB for data storage and Next.js for the frontend. It incorporates user authentication, recipe generation, and a user-friendly interface for managing recipes.

## Development Milestones

- **Tech Stack**: Set up a MERN stack, including MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, with TypeScript.

### User Authentication
- **next-auth**: Implemented user authentication using `next-auth` with Google as the OAuth provider.

### Recipe Generation
- **OpenAI API**: Integrated the OpenAI API to generate recipes based on user-selected ingredients and dietary preferences.
- **Image Generation**: Added functionality to generate recipe images using DALL-E from OpenAI.

### User Interface
- **Components**: Developed key UI components including Hero, Dashboard, Profile, and RecipeDisplayModal.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensured the app is responsive and user-friendly across various devices, including mobile.
- **Profile Component**: Implemented a profile page to display all recipes created by the user and in the future, other user-specific data.

### Likes System
- **Thumbs-Up Button**: Added a thumbs-up button for users to like recipes.
- **Toggle Like Function**: Implemented the backend logic to handle recipe likes, allowing users to like or unlike recipes.

### Data Management
- **MongoDB Connection**: Set up a connection to MongoDB and ensured efficient data retrieval and storage.
- **Recipe Storage**: Stored and managed recipes in MongoDB, including user likes and comments.

### Search Functionality
- **Search Bar**: Implemented a search bar to filter recipes.
- **Recipe Filtering**: Developed logic to filter and display recipes based on search input.

### Error Handling and Session Management
- **Session Management**: Ensured proper session management and authentication checks throughout the app.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for API requests and user interactions.

### Design Adjustments
- **UI Refinements**: Made various UI improvements based on feedback, including sticky headers and modal adjustments.
- **Styling**: Applied consistent styling using Tailwind CSS for a cohesive look and feel.

## Current Status
- **Functionality**: The app is fully functional with user authentication, recipe generation, recipe display, and liking functionality.
- **Profile Page**: A profile page is in place to show user-specific recipes.
- **Search**: A simplified search bar is available for filtering recipes.
- **Deployment**: Ready for the first deployment.

## Next Steps
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the app to a live environment.
- **Feedback**: Gather user feedback for further improvements.
- **Future Enhancements**: Plan for additional features like user comments, recipe sharing, and more.
